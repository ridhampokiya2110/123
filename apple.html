        Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I
        personal computer. The company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the
        Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in
        1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By
        1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles between
        executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for
        personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable market share to the
        lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.

        In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed operating system strategy and entice Jobs's
        return, it bought NeXT. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through several tactics
        including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the "Think different"
        campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous
        companies to broaden its product portfolio. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later.
        He was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
