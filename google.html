    <p>Google is an American multinational corporation and technology company focusing
        on online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software,
        quantum computing, e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI).
        It has been referred to as "the most powerful company in the world" and is one of the
        world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and
        technological advantages in the field of AI. Google's parent company,Alphabet Inc.,
        is one of the five Big Tech companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.</p>
    <p>Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page
        and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California.
        Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its
        stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via
        an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a
        wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary
        and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests.
        Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page,
        who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became
        the CEO of Alphabet..</p>
    <p>The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services
        beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products
        address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps),
        cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube),
        productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive),
        language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet),
        smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit),
        music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant & Gemini),
        machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more.
        Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+,
        Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.</p>
