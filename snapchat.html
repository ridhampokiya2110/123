        Snapchat is an American multimedia instant messaging app and service developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat
        Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a
        short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on
        person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content,
        along with "Discover", letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to store photos
        in a password-protected area called "My Eyes Only". It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of
        end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.

        Snapchat was created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, former students at Stanford University.
        It is known for representing a mobile-first direction for social media, and places significant emphasis on users
        interacting with virtual stickers and augmented reality objects. In July 2021, Snapchat had 293 million daily
        active users, a 23% growth over a year. On average more than four billion Snaps are sent each day.
        Snapchat is popular among the younger generations, particularly those below the age of 16, leading to many
        privacy concerns for parents.

        (pictures and video), according to a Snapchat security engineer presenting at the January 2019 Real World Crypto
        Conference.As of the January 2019 conference Snapchat had plans to introduce end-to-end
        encryption for text messages and group chats in the future.
