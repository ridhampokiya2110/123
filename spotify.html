        Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded audio content, including more than 100 million songs and 6
        million podcast titles, from record labels and media companies.Operating as a freemium service, the basic
        features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening
        and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Users can search for music based on artist,
        album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists. It offers some social media features, following
        friends and creating listening parties called "Jams".

        Spotify is available in most of Europe, as well as Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania, with a total
        availability in 184 markets. Its users and subscribers are based largely in the US and Europe, jointly
        accounting for around 53% of users and 67% of revenue. It has no presence in mainland China where the market
        is dominated by QQ Music. The service is available on most devices, including Windows, macOS, and Linux
        computers, iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, smart home devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Nest
        lines of products, and digital media players like Roku.As of December 2023, Spotify was the 47th
        most-visited website in the world with 24.78% of its traffic coming from the United States followed by Brazil
        with 6.51% according to data provided by Semrush.

        Unlike physical or download sales, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays
        royalties based on the number of artist streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. It distributes
        approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders (often record labels), who then pay artists based on
        individual agreements. While certain musicians have voiced objections to Spotify's royalty structure and its
        effect on record sales, others laud the service for offering a lawful option to combat piracy and for
        remunerating artists each time their music is played.
